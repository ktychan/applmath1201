\begin{document} \section{Mathematical techniques for differential equations (overview)}

Over the next two weeks, we will study mathematical techniques for differential equations. This page offers an overview. 

At the end of next few sections, we will be able to do the following.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Classify differential equations.
  \item Verify proposed solutions of differential equations and initial-value problems.
  \item Understand initial conditions and find equilibrium solutions. 
  \item Understand the logistic model.
  \item Solve simple differential equations and initial-value problems.
  \item Apply differential equations to solve some real-world problems.
  \item Use Bernoulli substitutions to solve certain non-linear differential equations.
  \item Use inexact methods to obtain qualitative information from differential equations.
\end{enumerate}
