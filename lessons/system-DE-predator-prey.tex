Visualization give us quick and dirty answers to many ``what if'' questions.  

\begin{example} 
  Let's play the role of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (\href{https://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca}{\ttfamily dfo-mpo.gc.ca}).  Fisheries in the Atlantic provinces report an increased shark (predator) sightings.  Concerns for diminishing tuna (prey) population and fishing boats safety are mounting. Calls for relocation of a portion of sharks are picking up momentum. 

  The population dynamics between tunas and sharks is described by the (scaled) vector field below. 

  Is shark relocation a good idea? % Can you see an optimal solution on the vector field?
