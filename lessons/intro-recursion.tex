\begin{document} \section{Recursive models}

Does geometric intuition always lead to the right choice of model?

\begin{example} \label{ex:intro-population}
  Our intern found some bacteria living in a petri dish and checked in every hour to find the following data. They created a log-log plot and suggested the model \(P = 100 t^{2}\). 

  \begin{minipage}{0.65\textwidth}
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{r|r|l}
      time \(t\)  & observed population \(P\) & intern's model \(P = 100 t^{2}\) \\ \midrule
      1 & 100     & \\ \midrule
      2 & 200     & \\ \midrule
      3 & 400     & \\ \midrule
      4 & 800     & \\ \midrule
      5 & 1600    & \\ \midrule
      6 & 3200    & \\ \midrule
      7 & unknown &  
    \end{tabular}
  \end{minipage}
  \begin{minipage}{0.3\textwidth}
    \centering
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \begin{loglogaxis}[height=2in, axis equal image, xlabel={\(\ln(t)\)}, ylabel={\(\ln(P)\)}]
        \addplot[only marks] coordinates {
            (1, 100) (2, 200) (3, 400) (4, 800) (5, 1600) (6, 3200)
          };
      \end{loglogaxis}
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{minipage}

  \faComment{} What is the population at \(t = 7\) predicted by our intern's model? Does this prediction make sense biologically?

  The above data exhibits certain pattern consistent with biological theory. Propose a description for \hlmain{such a pattern} in plain English.

Example~\ref{ex:intro-population} suggests that some natural phenomena can be described by an earlier version of itself. 

\begin{mdframed}[style=simple-compact]
 A \hlmain{recursive model} describes data in terms of one or more earlier versions of itself.
\end{mdframed}

\begin{example}
  Let \(w_{t}\) denote the weight (grams) of a radioactive material at time \(t\) (years). Such material loses half of its weight every \(10\) years. 
  \begin{enumerate}[wide]
    \item Suppose \(w_{0} = 100\). What is its weight in \(30\) years?
      \blanklines{10}
    \item Write down a mathematical expression for \(w_{t}\) using the provided description.
      \blanklines{20}
    \item Is this a recursive model?
      \blanklines{5}
  \end{enumerate}

\begin{example}
  % This is an example from Geoff's notes.  Is it a version of the Hardyâ€“Weinberg principle?
  Let \(p_{t}\) denote the probability (a number in the interval \([0,1]\)) that an allele currently carried by a male descended from another allele carried by a male \(t\) generations ago.  Such probabilities satisfy
  \[
     p_{0} = 1 \quad \text{and}\quad p_{t} = 0 \cdot p_{t - 1}  + \frac{1}{2} \cdot (1 - p_{t-1}) \text{ for } t \ge 1.
  \]
  \blanklines{8}
  \begin{enumerate}[wide]
    \item What is the probability of an allele currently carried by a male descended from a male two generations ago?
      \blanklines{10}
    \item Find a non-recursive mathematical description of \(p_{t}\), i.e., attempt to write \(p\) as a function of \(t\).
