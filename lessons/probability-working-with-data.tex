TODO: We should explain why random variables \(X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n}\) are be used to represent data collected from fields.

This is not a bad way to introduce random variables. We can introduce random variables as data collection devices.

Consider a certain population. Let \(X_{1}\) record the heights and \(X_{2}\) weights. More precisely, if \(i\) is someone in the population, then \(X_{1}(i)\) is the height of \(i\), and \(X_{2}(i)\) is the weight of \(i\).
