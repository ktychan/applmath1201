The law of total probability mathematically takes advantages of mutually exclusive and exhaustive events to compute probabilities.

First, let's express \(\mathbb{P}(E \cap F)\) in terms of \(\mathbb{P}(E \mid F)\).

If we divide the sample space into mutually exclusive and exhaustive events \(F_{1}\) and \(F_{2}\) and try to compute \(\mathbb{P}(E)\), then we should get ...

\faStar{} The law of total probability is the above pattern in full generality. Suppose \(B_{1}, \ldots, B_{n}\) are mutually exclusive and exhaustive events in a sample space \(\Omega\). The \hlmain{law of total probability} is a way to express \(\mathbb{P}(E)\) as

Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the other.

\begin{definition}[independent events]
  Two events \(E,F\) in a common sample space are said to be \hlmain{independent} if 
  \[
    \mathbb{P}(E \cap F) = \mathbb{P}(E) \mathbb{P}(F).
  \]
\end{definition}

\faStar{} If \(E,F\) are independent events, then
\begin{equation} \label{eq:probability-conditional-of-independent}
  \mathbb{P}(E \mid F) = \hspace{1.5in}
  \quad\text{ and }\quad
  \mathbb{P}(F \mid E) = \hspace{1.5in}
\end{equation}

The above offers several ways to identify independent events.

\begin{example} 
  Let \(E,F\) be two events in a sample space \(\Omega\). If \(E,F\) are independent events, does that imply \(E\) and \(F\) are mutually exclusive?  Conversely, if \(E,F\) are mutually exclusive, does that imply \(E\) and \(F\) are independent?
