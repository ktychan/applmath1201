Example~\ref{ex:general-solution-of-linear-first-order-diff-eq} shows that a certain family of functions are solutions to linear, first-order differential equations. However, it does not say whether there are solutions of other forms. It turns out that there aren't any other forms of solutions. 

\begin{mdframed}[style=simple-compact]
  Suppose \(p(t), q(t)\) are continuous functions. Consider a linear, first-order differential equation
  \begin{equation} \label{eq:linear-first-order-diff-eq}
    u'(t) + p(t) u(t) = q(t).
  \end{equation}
  
  Define \(v(t) = e^{\int p(t) \;dt}\). All solutions to Equation~\eqref{eq:linear-first-order-diff-eq} have the form
  \[
    u(t) = \frac{1}{v(t)} \left( \int v(t) q(t) \;dt + C \right), \quad\text{where \(C\) is a general constant}.
  \]
  or, equivalently,
  \[
    u(t) = \frac{1}{v(t)} \left( u(a)v(a) + \int_{a}^{t} v(x) q(x) \;dx \right), \quad\text{where \(u(a)\) is a general constant}.
  \]
\end{mdframed}

Here are the steps to find a \emph{general solution} to a linear, first-order differential equation.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Manipulate your differential equation to the form in Equation~\eqref{eq:linear-first-order-diff-eq}. 
  \item Identify \(p(t)\) and \(q(t)\).
  \item Calculate \(v(t)\).
  \item 
\end{enumerate}
