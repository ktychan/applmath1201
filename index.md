Nothing beats seeing the Eiffel tower by physically visiting it.  To communicate our understanding of the wonder to those who have not seen it in person, we can choose to omit some details, such as the shapes of rivets, so that we can focus on the big picture.  A LEGO model of the Eiffel tower does exactly that.  

We are already familiar with various mathematical models.  For example, Newtonian physics gives us a model for acceleration due to gravitation on Earth 
```{math}
:label: eq:model-acceleration
a = \dfrac{g t^{2}}{2}.
```

- It is a relation. It happens that acceleration {math}`a` is a function of the time variable {math}`t`. In general, models are not always functions but are equations relating several quantities mathematically.
